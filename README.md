# Miscellaneous Matlab files for the analyis and capture of stereo images
## CameraGUI.m
CameraGUI.m is a MATLAB Graphical User Interface (GUI) for stereo imaging capture using the [Image Acquisition Toolbox Support Package for Point Grey Hardware](https://uk.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/45178-image-acquisition-toolbox-support-package-for-point-grey-hardware). Thi GUI has been created to capture **synchronised** stereo images from Point Grey Cameras (Flea2 13S2) and it allows to:
- Select cameras adaptor (only tested with IEEE-1394b connector)
- Select the video format (image resolution and bit depth)
- Select cameras Gain, Shutter Speed and Frame Rate
- Select the filename and file directory where to save the image pairs captured
- Select the number and format of the image pairs captured
